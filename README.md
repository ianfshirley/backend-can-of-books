## Change Log


## Credit and Collaborations

### Team Agreement

#### Logistical

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?
- 1pm-5pm PST / 4pm-8pm EST
2. What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- Remo & slack
3. How often will you take breaks?
- 10 min break every 2 hours, and short breaks whenever needed for bathroom, water, etc.
4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- Getting help, and prioritizing this lab over code challenges and reading assignments

#### Cooperative

1. Make a list of each person’s strengths.
- Angelos: communication, CSS/boostrap
- Ian: task tracking, creating routes
2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
- Communication & task tracking will both help with pair programming, Angelos' CSS/bootstrap skills will help with front-end development, and Ian's ability to create routes will help to set up the back-end.
3. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Angelos: more bootstrap, react, and connecting front & back end
- Ian: basic JS logic, react in general
4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
- With one driver and one navigator, we won't move on from a task unless we both know what we have done.

#### Conflict Resolution

1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
- We both have good communication skills, so we will be open with each other and tell the other person if we feel one person is contributing too much or not enough.
2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
- As above, we will communicate with each other, but in the unlikely situation that we have a conflict, we can bring it up with the teaching staff.
3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- Asking each other questions, asking TAs for help if we are both struggling, and use each other's strenghts to make up for our individual weaknesses.
